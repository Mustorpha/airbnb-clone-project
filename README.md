# üè† Airbnb Clone ‚Äì Built with Django

Welcome to the **Airbnb Clone** project ‚Äì a backend-focused web application that replicates the core functionalities of Airbnb. Built with **Django**, this platform enables users to list, search, and book short-term rental properties. It supports role-based access for guests, hosts, and administrators while handling user authentication, bookings, property management, reviews, and potential payment flows.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the key backend systems of Airbnb with a focus on modularity, security, and maintainability. It allows:

- **Guests** to browse, search, and book available properties.
- **Hosts** to list properties with detailed descriptions and images.
- **Users** to register, log in, and manage bookings or listings.
- **Admins** to oversee users, listings, and bookings through Django‚Äôs admin panel.

The Airbnb Clone project demonstrates how to structure scalable Django applications using industry best practices, solid database design, and secure APIs.

## ‚ú® Feature Breakdown

### üë§ User Management
Handles registration, login, logout, and session control. Users can be either guests or hosts, with role-based access and dashboard views tailored to their needs.

### üè° Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Listings include location, price, description, and images. Each listing is tied to the host who created it.

### üìÖ Booking System
Guests can book properties for specific dates. The system validates availability before confirming bookings and prevents double-bookings. Bookings include check-in/out dates, user, and property info.

### ‚≠ê Review System
Guests can leave reviews after a stay. Reviews include ratings and comments and are tied to both the user and the property. This builds trust and accountability across the platform.

### üì§ Image Uploads
Property listings support image uploads using Pillow. Uploaded files are stored in a dedicated `media/` directory and rendered on property detail views.

### üîç Search & Filter
Users can search for properties by city or keyword. Listings can be filtered by price range or availability to help guests find suitable places quickly.

### üõ† Admin Panel
Admin users can log into Django‚Äôs admin interface to manage all models: users, bookings, properties, and reviews. Useful for moderation and support roles.

## üßÆ Database Design

### üßë Users
- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `username`: Login name  
- `email`: Unique contact  
- `password`: Hashed password  
- `is_host`: Boolean (True if host)  
- `date_joined`: User registration date  

Relationships:  
- One user can list many properties  
- One user can make many bookings  
- One user can leave many reviews  

### üè° Properties
- `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`, `host`, `image`  
- Belongs to one host  
- Can have many bookings and reviews  

### üìÖ Bookings
- `id`, `property`, `guest`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `status`  
- Each booking is tied to a property and a guest  

### ‚≠ê Reviews
- `id`, `property`, `user`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`  
- Each review belongs to one user and one property  

### üí≥ Payments (Optional)
- `id`, `booking`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_date`  
- Linked to a specific booking

## üõ°Ô∏è API Security

Security is a top priority in this project to protect user data, listings, bookings, and financial transactions.

### Authentication
- Token/session-based authentication ensures only verified users can access protected endpoints.  
- Passwords are stored securely using Django‚Äôs password hashing.

### Authorization
- Role-based access ensures hosts can list, guests can book, and only admins access admin features.

### Input Validation & Error Handling
- All user input is sanitized.  
- Forms and serializers protect against SQL injection and XSS attacks.  
- Clean error messages avoid exposing internal logic.

### Rate Limiting (Planned)
- Use tools like `django-ratelimit` or DRF throttling to prevent abuse.

### HTTPS Enforcement
- All production traffic is encrypted via HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and session hijacking.

### Secure Payments
- If implemented, payments use third-party processors like Stripe or PayPal.  
- Raw card data is never stored or transmitted directly by the backend.
